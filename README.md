# CareCycle: A Comprehensive Donation Platform

## Overview
CareCycle is a user-friendly web platform designed to connect donors with recipients efficiently. The platform allows donors to register and contribute resources such as blood, cash, or any other items they wish to donate. Recipients can request specific resources, and admins can organize and manage donation campaigns effectively. The goal is to streamline the process of finding donors in emergencies and to organize donation campaigns for various causes, creating a seamless cycle of care and support.

## Objectives
1. Develop a user-friendly web platform to connect donors with recipients.
2. Implement a secure registration and authentication system for users.
3. Enable tracking of available donors by resource type and location.
4. Provide an admin panel to monitor donor activities and verify requests.
5. Organize and manage donation campaigns effectively.
